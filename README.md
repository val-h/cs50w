CS50W - Course on Web Programming by Harvard.

With this course i try to refine my knowledge of web programming
(especially front-end) and to see how i perform on a graded scale.

Thos course includes:
    - HTML & CSS
    - Git
    - Python
    - Django
    - SQL, Models and Migrations
    - JavaScript
    - User Interfaces
    - Testing, CI/CD
    - Scalability and Security

I'm familiar with most of these and on a solid level of understanding 
to the ones i know. To be more precise, i haven't learned about CI/CD,
Scalability and Security.

I decided to do this course for:
    - Practice
    - New Fun Projects
    - New concepts to Learn
